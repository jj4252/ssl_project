# Data loading configuration for CIFAR-10/100
# Experiment: Train KD on CIFAR10, evaluate on CIFAR10 (same distribution)

# Dataset configuration
dataset_name: "cifar10"  # Options: "cifar10" or "cifar100"
dataset_root: "./data"  # Root directory for CIFAR data (will download if not present)
max_samples: null  # null = use full dataset (50K training images for CIFAR10)

# Image size
# CIFAR10 images are 32x32, will be upscaled to image_size for student
# Teacher will receive 224x224 (upscaled from student size)
image_size: 96  # Match student model size (will be upscaled from 32x32)

# DataLoader settings (optimized for Slurm)
num_workers: 2  # Reduced to prevent OOM
persistent_workers: false  # Must be false
prefetch_factor: 1  # Reduced to prevent OOM
pin_memory: true
